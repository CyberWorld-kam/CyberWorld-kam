<h2>👨‍💻CAREER GOALS:</h2>

I'm a dynamic and enthusiastic learner who is constantly seeking to learn more about the fields of cybersecurity and digital forensics in order to protect network infrastructures, information systems, and investigate cybercrimes. She also enjoys looking into the specifics of security incidents and cybercrimes in order to identify the perpetrators and determine what exactly happened. 

I support proactive cybersecurity, and I'm prepared to use my analytical abilities to help fortify any organization's defences against possible intruders.

<h2>👨‍💻Area of Interests:</h2>

- Vulnerability assessment and Penetration Testing,
- Digital forensics,
- Security analysis,
- SOC analysis,
- cybersecurity awareness.

<h2>👨‍💻 Personal Projects:</h2>

- <b>Vulnerability management(HomeLab)</b>
  - Set up a secure Azure network with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM.
  - Developed a vulnerable Windows 10 VM, featuring outdated software and disabled security controls.
  - Performed unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS.
  - Analyzed scan results, highlighting the difference between unauthenticated and credentialed scans.
  - Remediated identified vulnerabilities, verified successful remediation through subsequent scans.
  - Created a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic vulnerability remediation scenarios.

<h2>👨‍💻 My masters in Cybersecurity cursus Projects:</h2>

- <b>Achieving Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance through Industry Simulation Design and its Security controls(Minor Project)</b>

  - The goal of this project is to create a network infrastructure that is replicated throughout the business and industry and complies with SOX regulations. It also involves determining and putting into place 
   access control and security measures to protect financial reports, data, and the systems that house the aforementioned information.
  - Using VMware Workstation Pro and GNS3, a real-world business network was designed and simulated.
  - Implemented firewall, DMZ, and access control using Active Directory for identity provisioning and management.
  - Added backup functionality for system data backups.
  - Used ManageEngine EventLog Analyzer to gather logs and evaluate security occurrences.
  
  - [Overview of what was done](https://github.com/CyberWorld-kam/SchoolMinorPorject/)
    
- <b>Vehicle Tracking system and its security system(school's mini project)</b>

  - A system for tracking the whereabouts of cars and motorcycles was developed using a NodeMCU ESP8266 and a Neo m6 GPS module.
  - MIT App Inventor was used to create an application that shows the user's location on a map along with the latitude and longitude information.
  - Using Google Firebase, a real-time database was created to enable data viewing and real-time location mapping.


  - [Vehicle Tracking system and its security system:](https://github.com/CyberWorld-kam/IOT-mini-project) <b><i>(collection logs and mapping the Attacks)</b></i>

  
- <b>Sentinel SIEM(Azure)</b>

  - Used custom PowerShell script to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer to be forwarded to third party API to derive geolocation data
  - Configured Azure Sentinel (Microsoft's cloud SIEM) workbook to display global attack data (RDP brute force) on a world map according to physical location and magnitude of attacks.
